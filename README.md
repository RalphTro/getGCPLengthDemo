# getGCPLengthDemo

This is a simple DEMO SOFTWARE intended to illustrate how to apply GS1's GCP (GS1 Company Prefix) Length Table (available either in XML or JSON) residing at https://www.gs1.org/standards/bc-epc-interop.

## Before we go on: what is the issue?

If you would like to encode an RFID tag with a proper EPC (Electronic Product Code) or share visibility event data through EPCIS, you need to know the length of the GS1 Company Prefix. Amongst others, this was introduced to ease filtering in RFID read operations or in software applications (e.g. RFID middleware or EPCIS-based software systems).

The length of the GCP can vary (in the case of RFID tags, between 6 and 12 digits). It is based on an organisation's required identification capacity. For instance, someone who sells just a couple of dozens of products through an e-commerce platform, can manage with a 10-digit GCP, allowing him to identify up to 100 products (identified by a Global Trade Item Number or GTIN). However, a multi-national corporation that introduces several hundreds or thousands of products each year, requires much more products, thus is assigned by its local GS1 Member Organisation e.g. a 7-digit GCP enabling the company to identify up 100,000 products.

## Example: SGTIN
For instance, if you need to encode a serialised GTIN (Global Trade Item Number) on an RFID tag, or capture/query for EPCIS events in an EPCIS repository, the GTIN
